# Food-Price-Data-Analysis
"A data analysis project on food prices across different provinces."
This repository contains the code and documentation for a data analysis project on food prices across various provinces, completed as part of my B.Sc. in Computer Science at Virtual University of Pakistan The project involved collecting data from reputable sources, cleaning the data by handling missing values and removing outliers, and performing numerical computing and data manipulation using Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas. The analysis aimed to uncover trends and patterns in food prices, providing valuable insights for stakeholders. Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight these trends across different commodities and regions.
